# Summary 

- Parent class Employees was created.

- This enables data to be grouped logically, making it easy to re-use and build upon if required.

- A subclass(child) called Developers was created which re-used Employees code, but also incorporates a "prog_lang" argument which means when a new instance is added it should feature a value. 

- E.g when a new developer into the data- the programming language which they specialise in needs to be specified. 

- This means that Developer class Inherits all methods and properties from Employee class
